## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything you were confused about.

```md
Nothing really--I was glad to see the reading on function declarations vs. expressions because that was something I had been wondering about. Many of the online tutorials I had done primarily favored function declarations, and I had wondered why we'd avoided them in class so far.

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

```md
Not at the moment.
